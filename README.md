💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Teddy Dickson!

I’m currently working on
Building real-world projects to strengthen my full-stack development skills, especially focusing on React, Django, and overall backend logic. I’m also working on documenting my learning journey and building solutions that solve everyday problems.

I’m looking to collaborate on

Projects that will help me grow my portfolio and give me more hands-on, practical experience. I’m open to collaborations, beginner-friendly teams, and internship opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and improve.

I’m looking for help with

My current project — a land verification and scam-reporting app. I’m working on structuring the backend, designing clean frontend flows, and improving my overall system design and architecture.

I’m currently learning

React.js
Bootstrap (CDN)
Django
Git & GitHub workflow

Ask me about
Web development basics, frontend-to-backend transition, Django setup, React components, learning paths, or anything tech-journey related.

Fun fact

I learn better by building than by just reading. Once I touch code, everything starts making sense!
